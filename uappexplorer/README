This is a new approach of an alternate webapp container that
does not use a toolbar at the top but instead provides a bottom
menu with navigation objects, similar to the one the dekko mail
app uses. This way you do not have a jiggly toolbar that always
expands and collapses in your app.

To make use of this with your own webapp just follow the steps below.

Fist of all branch this tree locally ...

    bzr branch lp:~ogra/junk/alternate-webapp-container

== Building ==

Edit the value of applicationName at the top of qml/Main.qml to match
your application name to work around https://launchpad.net/bugs/1435778

Edit config.js to add webappName, webappUrl and webappUrlPattern 
similar to how you would use them as commandline options to webapp-container.

Optionally you can set the webappUA variable in config.js to override
the User Agent string.

Edit app.desktop and manifest.json to your liking.
Replace icon.png with your own icon.

Now run:
    click build .

This will create a .click package with you webapp.

== Installing ==

Push the click to your device via adb, then:

    adb shell pkcon install-local --allow-untrusted /path/to/click

You will see a bunch of progress bars ... once they are done,
pull down the app scope to refresh it and find your new app in there.
